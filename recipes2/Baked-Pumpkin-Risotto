        <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This baked Pumpkin Risotto looks thoroughly unimpressive when it comes out of the oven. But with a few big stirs, it miraculously transforms into a luxurious, CREAMY risotto with a magnificent colour that no one can resist!. </p>

            <li>1 onion , diced</li>

            <li>2 tbsp sage leaves, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <H4>Crispy Sage & Brown Butter (optional)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
                <li>12 - 20 sage leaves </li>
            </ul>
         <H4>To Garnish</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Grated Parmesan</li>
            </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180C.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tbsp butter in ovenproof pot (preferably with a lid) over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and onion and cook until onion is translucent.</li>
            <li>Add chopped sage and cook for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add rice and stir so all the rice grains are coated with the butter and semi translucent.</li>
            <li>Add white wine and cook until the the liquid evaporates - about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add pumpkin and broth, stir. Let the liquid heat up but do not bring to simmer. </li>
            <li>Put lid on (or cover tightly with foil) and place in oven for 25 minutes, until rice is just cooked (firm but not raw) - don't worry if there's excess liquid. If rice is still uncooked, return to oven for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add remaining butter and parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Stir vigorously until the pumpkin turns into a puree and blends into the risotto. If it's too thick then add a splash of hot tap water. Should have a porridge like consistency so it sags a bit when served (see video), rather than staying in a tall, firm pile.</li>
            <li>Spoon into serving bowls. Garnish with crispy sage, 1 or 2 teaspoons of brown butter and parmesan cheese. Devour immediately!</li>
        </ol>
